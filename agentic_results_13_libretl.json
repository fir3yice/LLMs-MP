        "justification": "The translation captures all the essential elements of the English source. It clearly states the absence of respect and love and provides the direct instruction to leave. The \"na\" in \"iwan mo na\" adds a subtle nuance of \"already\" or \"now,\" which is a natural addition in Filipino that doesn't alter the core meaning."
